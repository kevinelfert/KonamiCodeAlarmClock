# KonamiCodeAlarmClock
An alarm clock that can only be shut off by inputting the Konami Code

On Windows
Using PyGame 2.1.2 and a PlayStation 4 Controller

On Mac
Using PyGame 2.0.1 and a PlayStation 4 Controller

On Linux (Raspbian)
Using PyGame 1.9.4 and a PlayStation 4 Controller

The reason for the different version is that I can't find a uniform version of pygame that works on all three OSs
