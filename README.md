# KonamiCodeAlarmClock
An alarm clock that can only be shut off by inputting the Konami Code

On Windows
Using PyGame 2.1.2 and a PlayStation 4 Controller

On Mac
Using PyGame 2.0.1 and a PlayStation 4 Controller

On Linux (Raspbian)
Using PyGame 1.9.4 and a PlayStation 4 Controller

The reason for the different version is that I can't find a uniform version of pygame that works on all three OSs


The Konami code is Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start

On the PlayStation 4 controller, use the D-pad, the O button for B, the X button for A, and the Options button for Start

You can use the Keyboard as well
Press u for Up, d for Down, l for Left, r for Right, b for B, a for A, and Enter for Start
